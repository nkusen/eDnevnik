# eDnevnik
A web scraper I used to calculate grade averages in high school.
eDnevnik is a system used to store grades of elementary and high school students in Croatia. In 2020 (I think) they removed the calculated grade average from their system.
Because of that students would need to calculate their average "by hand" or use eDnevnik+, a chrome extension that callculated the average grade and printed it where it
was before. I made this web scraper to calculate my grades and it can be used by any student. A user  needs to input their AAI credidentials and the program will log into
their account and calculate the average grade for each subject.
